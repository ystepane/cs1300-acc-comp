        <h3> Welcome to my exploration of dropdown lists! 
          This case study dives into how dropdown menus can be designed to be more user-friendly and inclusive. 
          We'll look at how different input methods (like mouse, keyboard, and touch) interact with dropdowns across various applications, 
          and how these components visually and textually represent their states. 
          You'll see how we can redesign dropdowns to balance ease of use, efficiency, and accessibility, making them better for everyone (or almost everyone!). 
          Join me on this journey to make dropdown lists more accessible and enjoyable for all users! 🚀
        </h3>
        <h4>Note: Since we are exploring Dropdown Lists, each part of this case study is under a dropdown list itself :)

            <p> Welcome to our interactive playground, where every click, swipe, and hover brings your digital experience to life! 🌟
              <br>
              This website is designed to be more than just a collection of pages — it's a dynamic journey where inputs and outputs work together to create an enjoyable experience. <br>
              We will explore how different platforms implement a well known component - a dropdown list - in different, yet similar ways!</p>
            <p>Below, you can choose one of 3 components I looked into and explore what interactoins with them look like for mouse and keyboard users. The interactions are represented by gif videos. For accessibility purposes, you will need to Click on the image to reveal the video. You can hide it by clicking again. You can choose to watch one, two or none videos at the same time.</p>

            <h3>State Models for Slack</h3>
            <p>
              We're taking our exploration to the next level by diving into the world of state models and user interactions.
              Using the insights you've gathered about interactions and accessibility from Parts 1 and 2, it's time to create your own version of a selected component. 
              We'll start by thinking about the different states it can be in and how users interact with it.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, we'll create two state models to visualize these interactions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>How does the component respond to clicks, hovers, and other mouse actions?</li>
              <li>How does the component handle focus, key presses, and other keyboard interactions?</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="state-models">
              <div class="state-column">
                <h4>Mouse User State Model (Click to Expand)</h4>
                <img src="pics/mouse.png" alt="Mouse User State Model Initial" aria-label="Mouse User State Model Initial" class="expandable-image" />
                <img src="pics/mouse_new.png" alt="Mouse User State Model Revised" aria-label="Mouse User State Model Revised" class="expandable-image" />

              </div>
              <div class="state-column">
                <h4>Keyboard User State Model (Click to Expand)</h4>
              <img src="pics/keyboard.png" alt="Keyboard User State Model Initial" aria-label="Keyboard User State Model Initial" class="expandable-image" />
                <img src="pics/keyboard_new.png" alt="Keyboard User State Model Revised" aria-label="Keyboard User State Model Revised" class="expandable-image" />
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              Next, we'll be revising state models. 
              We will make an intentional trade-off to alter how we perceive the learnability, memorability, 
              efficiency, and accessibility of the dropdown component.
            </p>
            <div class="state-models">
              <div class="state-column">
                <h4>(Click to Expand) Idle State</h4>
  <img src="pics/slack_idle.png" alt="Slack Idle State" aria-label="Slack Idle State" class="expandable-image" />
              </div>
              <div class="state-column">
                <h4>Selected Dropdown List</h4>
                <img src="pics/slack_state1.png" alt="Slack Selected Dropdown List" aria-label="Slack Selected Dropdown List" class="expandable-image" />

              </div>
              <div class="state-column">
                <h4>Improved Version with Trade-off</h4>
                <img src="pics/slack_ann.png" alt="Slack Improved Version with Trade-off" aria-label="Slack Improved Version with Trade-off" class="expandable-image" />
              </div>
            </div>
            <h3>Trade Off Idea</h3>
            <p>
              In Slack (and many other applications/websites), the learnability and intuitiveness of navigating dropdown lists without using a mouse are not great. 
              It is difficult to understand what is clickable/expandable and with which keys. <br>
              To improve this, I propose the following trade-off:
              <li>When a key is pressed (say, Fn6 in Slack to get started with mouse-less use), every other icon that can be accessed by pressing Fn6 
                is highlighted in the same color. Icons that aren’t accessible by Fn6, such as the dropdown menu, would display a hint in gray indicating 
                the appropriate button to use. You can turn this function on and off by using the Alt key.
                This approach improves learnability and usability but relies on color, which might be less effective 
                for visually impaired users and could take longer to learn and adjust to.
  </li>
  <li>For mouse users, I would implement a feature similar to what Spotify already has—when hovering over an option, the “shortcut” or accessible way of getting there is displayed. This also improves learnability for users who might need to navigate without a mouse.
  </li>
  This trade off can (and is, in my model) be applied to a broader design: rather than just using it for the dropdown lists only, it can be used for the whole interface. It will make the user experience much better.

                Addressing Unaddressed Accessibility Considerations
              </summary>
              <p>
                <strong>Color Dependence:</strong> My design initially relied on
                color to indicate accessibility, which could be problematic for
                visually impaired users. To address this, I included text hints
                and tooltips to provide additional guidance.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Screen Reader Support:</strong> Ensuring that all
                interactive elements are properly labeled and announced by screen
                readers was a key consideration that I incorporated into my
                design.

              <summary>Solving for a "Mismatch"</summary>
              <p>
                <strong>Mismatch Definition:</strong> According to the Kat Holmes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iccWRhKZa8">video</a> "Rethink What Inclusive Design Means", a mismatch occurs when the
                design of a product does not meet the needs of its users, creating
                barriers to use.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Solving the Mismatch:</strong> By highlighting accessible
                icons and providing hints for non-accessible elements, my design
                addresses the mismatch of unclear navigation for keyboard users.
                This change makes it easier for users to understand and use the
                dropdown menu without a mouse, improving overall accessibility.

              <summary>Impact of Accessibility on Users with Impairments</summary>
              <div class="impact-container">
                <div class="impact-section positive-impact">
                  <h4>Positive Impact</h4>
                  <p><strong>Keyboard Navigation in File Explorer:</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> Users with motor impairments can
                    navigate and select options using only the keyboard, making
                    the application more accessible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> A user with limited hand mobility
                    can efficiently use the dropdown menu without needing precise
                    mouse movements.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Screen Reader Announcements in Slack:</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> Users with visual impairments can
                    understand the current state and options of the dropdown menu
                    through screen reader announcements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> A user who is blind can navigate and
                    select options in the dropdown menu with the help of clear
                    audio feedback.
                  </p>
                </div>

                  <h4>Negative Impact</h4>
                  <p><strong>Color-Dependent Indicators in Slack:</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> Users with color vision deficiencies
                    may struggle to distinguish between accessible and
                    non-accessible elements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> A user with red-green color
                    blindness may not be able to see the highlighted icons, making
                    navigation difficult.
                  </p>

                    <strong>Complex Keyboard Shortcuts in Google Sheets:</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> Users with cognitive impairments may
                    find it challenging to remember and use complex keyboard
                    shortcuts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Example:</strong> A user with a learning disability
                    may struggle to navigate the dropdown menu due to the
                    difficulty in remembering the required key combinations.

              <summary>Prioritization of User Groups in Component Design</summary>
              <p>
                <strong>Commonly Prioritized Users:</strong> Mouse Users: Often
                prioritized due to the prevalence of mouse-based interactions in
                desktop applications. This can lead to highly intuitive and
                efficient mouse interactions but may neglect the needs of
                keyboard, touch/mobile, and screen reader users.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Impact on User Experience:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Keyboard Users:</strong> May experience less intuitive
                  navigation if keyboard shortcuts are not well-documented or easy
                  to use.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Touch/Mobile Users:</strong> May face challenges if
                  touch targets are not optimized for mobile interactions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Screen Reader Users:</strong> May struggle with
                  accessibility if interactive elements are not properly labeled
                  or announced.
                </li>
